# Translations

Landing for docs in need of translation.  

GetBlok.io will post documents the require translation in this public repo. Bounties (in ERG) will be set per translation.  
Please note that ALL translations must be true (not Google Translate) and will be verified prior to payment. 

Please post a comment on the document if you plan on contrinuting to a specific language to avoid duplication in work.

Completed documents must be submited via pull requests along with ERG address.  

See individual document for further details.
